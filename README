A MySQL database will be needed to run this application.  The application needs to connect to a database named "go" with user/pass of "go"/"GO" on localhost.

You will need a properly set up go environment with the environment variable GOPATH set.
mkdir ~/go && export GOPATH=~/go

go get github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
go get github.com/gorilla/mux
go get github.com/chipmanc/go_challenge/
go install github.com/chipmanc/go_challenge/go_challenge_server
go install github.com/chipmanc/go_challenge/go_challenge_load_db

To load a blacklist:
~/go/bin/go_challenge_load_db <FILE WITH URLS OR NET LOCATION OF BLACKLIST>
i.e.  ~/go/bin/go_challenge_load_db https://zeustracker.abuse.ch/blocklist.php?download=compromised

To start server:
~/go/bin/go_challenge_server
